#### **3.5 Scheduling**
- **Description:** Enables seamless discovery of mutual availability between participants.
- **Key Functionalities:**
  - Algorithms to find the earliest mutually available time slot.
  - Efficiently find overlaps between availabilities of multiple participants between a time range.
  - One-click scheduling for invitees via booking links.
  - Booked or cancelled events should be reflected in the availability of the participants.

---

### **4. User Stories**

#### **4.1 As a user,**
- I want to connect my Calendar to Calendly so that my events sync in real-time.
- I want to create a 30-minute consultation event type so I can schedule calls with clients.
- I want to define my availability so that Iâ€™m not booked during personal time.
- I want to share my scheduling link to let others book a time with me effortlessly.
- I want to reschedule an event easily if my plans change.

---

### **5. Assumptions and Constraints**

- No support for enterprise-level features like SSO in the MVP.
- No support for more than one calendar in the MVP.
- Platform supports only English language initially.
- MVP does not support any notifications but the platform should be able to easily integrate with notifications in future.
- The MVP does not support Recurring Events
- The MVP does not support multiple timezones. All events should be considered to be in UTC time.
- User Authentication is not supported in the MVP. The responsibility of privacy and security is left to the caller.

### **6. Test Cases**

#### **6.1 User Availability Patterns**

| User Type | Availability Pattern | Description |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Weekday User | Monday-Friday | Available on weekdays only |
| Midweek User | Wednesday-Saturday | Available mid-week through weekend |
| Weekend User | Saturday-Sunday | Available on weekends only |

#### **6.2 Overlap Scenarios**

| Test Case | Participants | Time Period | Expected Behavior | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| All Users No Overlap | Weekday, Midweek, Weekend users | Monday 9 AM - 5 PM | No overlapping slots | No time period exists where all three users are available |
| Weekday-Midweek Friday Overlap | Weekday and Midweek users | Friday 9 AM - 5 PM | 2 overlapping slots | Both users are available on Fridays |
| Midweek-Weekend Saturday Overlap | Midweek and Weekend users | Saturday 9 AM - 5 PM | 1 overlapping slot | Both users are available on Saturdays |
| No Common Availability | Weekday and Weekend users | Saturday 9 AM - 5 PM | No overlapping slots | Users have mutually exclusive schedules |

#### **6.3 System Behavior Requirements**

1. **Availability Rules**
   - System must correctly handle multiple availability rules per user
   - Each user type should have the correct number of availability rules:
     - Weekday user: 5 rules (Mon-Fri)
     - Midweek user: 4 rules (Wed-Sat)
     - Weekend user: 2 rules (Sat-Sun)

2. **Overlap Detection**
   - System must efficiently find overlapping availabilities between multiple users
   - Must consider both:
     - User-defined availability rules
     - Existing calendar events

3. **Time Handling**
   - All times must be handled in UTC
   - System must properly handle day-of-week based rules
   - Must support time ranges within a single day (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM)


#### **6.4 Additional Test Scenarios**

##### **A. Working Hours Patterns**

| User Type | Availability Pattern | Description |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Early Bird | Monday-Friday, 6 AM - 2 PM | Early shift worker |
| Night Owl | Monday-Friday, 2 PM - 10 PM | Late shift worker |
| Split Shift | Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 1 PM, 4 PM - 8 PM | Break in middle of day |
| Flexible Hours | Monday-Friday, varying blocks | Different hours each day |

**Test Cases:**
1. Early Bird + Regular (9-5) Overlap
2. Night Owl + Regular (9-5) Overlap
3. Split Shift + Regular (9-5) Partial Overlap
4. Multiple Split Shift Users Overlap

##### **B. Partial Availability Patterns**

| User Type | Availability Pattern | Description |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Part-Time | Mon, Wed, Fri, 9 AM - 3 PM | Limited weekdays |
| Morning Only | Monday-Friday, 7 AM - 12 PM | Morning availability |
| Afternoon Only | Monday-Friday, 1 PM - 6 PM | Afternoon availability |
| Custom Days | Tue, Thu, Sat, 10 AM - 6 PM | Specific days only |

**Test Cases:**
1. Part-Time + Full-Time Overlap
2. Morning Only + Afternoon Only No Overlap
3. Custom Days + Weekend User Overlap
4. Multiple Part-Time Users Common Slots

##### **C. Edge Cases**

| Scenario | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Boundary Time | Meeting at availability boundary (e.g., 5 PM) | Should consider end time in availability check |
| Minimum Duration | 15-min slots between different availability patterns | Should find minimal overlapping windows |
| Maximum Participants | 10+ users with different patterns | Should efficiently find common slots |
| Multi-Day Event | Event spanning multiple days | Should handle events spanning multiple days |

**Test Cases:**
1. Boundary Time Overlap Detection
2. Short Duration Multi-User Overlap
3. Large Group Common Availability
4. Holiday Period Availability

##### **D. System Load Patterns**

| Test Type | Description | Expected Performance |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Large Date Range | 6-month availability window | Efficient processing |
| Multiple Rules | User with 20+ availability rules | Quick rule evaluation |
| Dense Calendar | Calendar with 100+ existing events | Fast overlap detection |

**Test Cases:**
1. Concurrent User Requests
2. Extended Time Range Search
3. Complex Rule Combination
4. High Event Density Processing

These additional test suites ensure:
- Support for diverse working patterns
- Efficient handling of time zone differences
- Proper management of partial availability
- System performance under various loads
- Correct handling of edge cases and boundary conditions
